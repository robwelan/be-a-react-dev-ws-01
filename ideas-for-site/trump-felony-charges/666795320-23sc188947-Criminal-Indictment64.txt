       This criminal organization constituted an enterprise as that term is deﬁned in O.C.G.A.      §


l6-14-3(3), that is,   a group   of individuals associated in fact. The Defendants and other members

and associates   of the enterprise had connections and relationships with one another and with the

enterprise. 'The enterprise constituted an ongoing organization whose members and associates

functioned as a continuing unit for a common purpose of achieving the objectives of the

enterprise. The enterprise operated in Fulton County, Georgia, elsewhere in the State of Georgia,

in other states, including, but not limited to, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico,

Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and in the District of Columbia. The enterprise operated for a

period of time sufﬁcient to permit its members and associates to pursue its objectives.

                      MANNER AND METHODS OF THE ENTERPRISE

        The manner and methods used by the Defendants and other members and associates of

the enterprise to further the goals   of the enterprise and to achieve its purposes included, but were

not limited to, the following:

        1.   False Statements to and Solicitation of State Legislatures

        Members of the enterprise, including several of the Defendants, appeared at hearings in

Fulton County, Georgia, before members of the Georgia General Assembly on December 3,

2020, December 10, 2020, and December 30, 2020. At these hearings, members of the enterprise

made false statements concerning fraud in the November 3, 2020, presidential election. The


purpose   of these false statements was to persuade Georgia legislators to reject lawﬁll electoral

votes cast by the duly elected and qualiﬁed presidential electors from Georgia. Members of the

enterprise corruptly solicited Georgia legislators instead to unlawﬁllly appoint their own

presidential electors for the purpose of casting electoral votes for Donald Trump. Members of the

enterprise also made false statements to state legislators during hearings and meetings in

Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania in November and December 2020 to persuade legislators

in those states to unlawﬁllly appoint their own presidential electors.

       2. False Statements to and Solicitation of HighRanking State Ofﬁcials

       Members of the enterprise, including several of the Defendants, made false statements in

Fulton County and elsewhere in the State of Georgia to Georgia officials, including the

Governor, the Secretary   cf State, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Members of
the enterprise also corruptly solicited Georgia officials, including the Secretary   of State and the

Speaker of the House of Representatives, to violate their oaths to the Georgia Constitution and to

the United States Constitution by unlawfully changing the outcome        of the November 3, 2020,




                                                   16
presidential election in Georgia in favor of Donald Trump. Members of the enterprise also made

false statements to and solicited state ofﬁcials in Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.

        3. Creation and Distribution of False Electoral College Documents

        Members of the enterprise, including several of the Defendants, created false Electoral

College documents and recruited individuals to convene and cast false Electoral College votes at

the Georgia State Capitol, in Fulton County, on December 14, 2020. After the false Electoral


College votes were cast, members of the enterprise transmitted the votes to the President of the

United States Senate, the Archivist of the United States, the Georgia Secretary of State, and the

Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The false

documents were intended to disrupt and delay the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021,

in order to unlawfully change the outcome of the November 3, 2020, presidential election in

favor of Donald Trump. Similar schemes were executed by members of the enterprise in Arizona,

Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

        4. Harassment and Intimidation of Fulton        Countv Election Worker Rubv Freeman

       Members of the enterprise, including several of the Defendants, falsely accused Fulton

County election worker Ruby Freeman of committing election crimes in Fulton County, Georgia.

These false accusations were repeated to Georgia legislators and other. Georgia ofﬁcials in an

effort to persuade them to unlawfully change the outcome of the November 3, 2020, presidential

election in favor of Donald Trump. In furtherance of this scheme, members of the enterprise

traveled from out of state to harass Freeman, intimidate her, and solicit her to falsely confess to

election crimes that she did not commit.

        5. Solicitation of High-Ranking United States Department of Justice Ofﬁcials

       Members of the enterprise, including several of the Defendants, corruptly solicited high-

ranking United States Department of Justice ofﬁcials to make false statements to government

ofﬁcials in Fulton County, Georgia, including the Governor, the Speaker of the House of

Representatives, and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. In one instance, Donald Trump

stated to the Acting United States Attorney General, "Just say that the election was corrupt, and
                                                                                    -




leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen."

       6.    Solicitation of the Vice President of the United States

       Members of the enterprise, including several of the Defendants, corruptly solicited the

Vice President of the United States to violate the United States Constitution and federal law by

unlawﬁilly rejecting Electoral College votes cast in Fulton County, Georgia, by the duly elected

and qualiﬁed presidential electors ﬁom Georgia. Members      of the enterprise also corruptly

solicited the Vice President to reject votes cast by the duly elected and qualiﬁed presidential

electors ﬁom several other states.

       7._   Unlawful Breach of Election Equipment in Georgia and Elsewhere

       Members of the enterprise, including several of the Defendants, corruptly conspired in

Fulton County, Georgia, and elsewhere to unlawﬁllly access secure voting equipment and voter

data. In Georgia, members   of the enterprise stole data, including ballot images, voting equipment

software, and personal voter information. The stolen data was then distributed to other members

of the enterprise, including members in other states.

CONFIDENTIAL Dec 23 memo on Jan 6 scenario.docx" and stated, "As for hearings, I think
                     --




both are unnecessary. The fact that we have multiple slates of electors demonstrates the
uncertainty of either. That should be enough. And I agree with Ken that Judiciary Committee
hearings on the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act could invite counter views that we do
not believe should constrain Pence (or Grassley) in the exercise of power they have under the
12th Amendment. Better for them just to act boldly and be challenged, since the challenge would

likely lead to the Court denying review on nonjusticiable political question grounds." This was
an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.

       they debated the Arizona objections for more than 2 hours. Violation of 3 USC
       l7. And the VP allowed fmther debate or statements by leadership after the
       question had been voted upon. Violation of 3 USC 17. And they had that debate
       upon motion approved by the VP, in violation of the requirement in 3 USC 15 that
       after the vote in the separate houses, 'they shall immediately again meet.'

       So now that the precedent has been set that the Electoral Count Act is not quite so
       sacrosanct as was previously claimed, I implore you to consider one more
       relatively minor violation and adjourn for 10 days to allow the legislatures to
       ﬁnish their investigations, as well as to allow a full forensic audit of the massive
       amount of illegal activity that has occurred here. If none of that moves the
