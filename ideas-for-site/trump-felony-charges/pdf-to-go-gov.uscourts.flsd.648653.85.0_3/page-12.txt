30. In May 2021, TRUMP directed that a storage room on the ground floor of The
Mar-a-Lago Club (the “Storage Room”) be cleaned out so that it could be used to store his boxes.
The hallway leading to the Storage Room could be reached from multiple outside entrances,
including one accessible from The Mar-a-Lago Club pool patio through a doorway that was often
kept open. The Storage Room was near the liquor supply closet, linen room, lock shop, and various
other rooms.

31. On June 24, 2021, TRUMP’s boxes that were in the Lake Room were moved to
the Storage Room. After the move, there were more than 80 boxes in the Storage Room, as

depicted in the photographs below.
