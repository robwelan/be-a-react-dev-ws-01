Case 9:23-cr-80101-AMC Document 85 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2023 Page 17 of 60

Country A. The document that TRUMP possessed and showed on July 21, 2021, is charged as
Count 32 in this Superseding Indictment.

36. In August or September 2021, when he was no longer president, TRUMP met in
his office at The Bedminster Club with a representative of his political action committee (the “PAC
Representative”). During the meeting, TRUMP commented that an ongoing military operation in
Country B was not going well. TRUMP showed the PAC Representative a classified map of
Country B and told the PAC Representative that he should not be showing the map to the PAC
Representative and to not get too close. The PAC Representative did not have a security clearance
or any need-to-know classified information about the military operation.

37. On February 16, 2017, four years before TRUMP’s disclosures of classified
information set forth above, TRUMP said at a press conference:

The first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the
press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You
know why? Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be
ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave
out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves.
Really ashamed.

TRUMP’s Production of 15 Cardboard Boxes to the
National Archives and Records Administration

 

38. Beginning in May 2021, the National Archives and Records Administration
(“NARA”), which was responsible for archiving presidential records, repeatedly demanded that
TRUMP turn over presidential records that he had kept after his presidency. On multiple
occasions, beginning in June, NARA warned TRUMP through his representatives that if he did

not comply, it would refer the matter of the missing records to the Department of Justice.
