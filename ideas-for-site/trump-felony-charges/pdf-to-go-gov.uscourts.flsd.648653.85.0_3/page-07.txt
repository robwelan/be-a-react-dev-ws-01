Case 9:23-cr-80101-AMC Document 85 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2023 Page 7 of 60

18. Pursuant to Executive Order 13526, information classified at any level could be
lawfully accessed only by persons determined by an appropriate United States government official
to be eligible for access to classified information and who had signed an approved non-disclosure
agreement, who received a security clearance, and who had a “need-to-know” the classified
information. After his presidency, TRUMP was not authorized to possess or retain classified
documents.

19. Executive Order 13526 provided that a former president could obtain a waiver of
the “need-to-know” requirement, if the agency head or senior agency official of the agency that
originated the classified information: (1) determined in writing that access was consistent with the
interest of national security and (2) took appropriate steps to protect classified information from
unauthorized disclosure or compromise and ensured that the information was safeguarded in a
manner consistent with the order. TRUMP did not obtain any such waiver after his presidency.

20. As part of his official duties as president, TRUMP received intelligence briefings
from high-level United States government officials, including briefings from the Director of the
Central Intelligence Agency, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, senior White House
officials, and a designated briefer. He regularly received a collection of classified intelligence
from the United States Intelligence Community (“USIC”) known as the “President’s Daily Brief.”

21. | The USIC’s mission was to collect, analyze, and deliver foreign intelligence and
counterintelligence information to America’s leaders, including the president, policymakers, law

enforcement, and the military, so they could make sound decisions to protect the United States.
