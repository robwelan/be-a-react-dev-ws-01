to remain secret. DE OLIVEIRA also told Trump Employee 5 that NAUTA wanted DE
OLIVEIRA to talk to Trump Employee 4 to see how long camera footage was stored.

82. Shortly after arriving in Palm Beach on the evening of June 25, NAUTA went to
The Mar-a-Lago Club and met with DE OLIVEIRA at 5:46 p.m. At The Mar-a-Lago Club,
NAUTA and DE OLIVEIRA went to the security guard booth where surveillance video is
displayed on monitors, walked with a flashlight through the tunnel where the Storage Room was
located, and observed and pointed out surveillance cameras.

83. On Monday, June 27, 2022, at 9:48 a.m., DE OLIVEIRA walked to the IT office
where Trump Employee 4 was working with another employee in the IT department. DE
OLIVEIRA requested that Trump Employee 4 step away from the office so that DE OLIVEIRA
and Trump Employee 4 could talk.

84. At 9:49 a.m., Trump Employee 4 and DE OLIVEIRA left the area of the IT office
together and walked through a basement tunnel. DE OLIVEIRA took Trump Employee 4 to a
small room known as an “audio closet” near the White and Gold Ballroom. Once inside the audio
closet, DE OLIVEIRA and Trump Employee 4 had the following exchange:

a. DE OLIVEIRA told Trump Employee 4 that their conversation should
remain between the two of them.

b. DE OLIVEIRA asked Trump Employee 4 how many days the server
retained footage. Trump Employee 4 responded that he believed it was
approximately 45 days.

c. DE OLIVEIRA told Trump Employee 4 that “the boss” wanted the server
deleted. Trump Employee 4 responded that he would not know how to do
that, and that he did not believe that he would have the rights to do that.
Trump Employee 4 told DE OLIVEIRA that DE OLIVEIRA would have
to reach out to another employee who was a supervisor of security for
TRUMP’s business organization. DE OLIVEIRA then insisted to
TRUMP Employee 4 that “the boss” wanted the server deleted and asked,
“what are we going to do?”
