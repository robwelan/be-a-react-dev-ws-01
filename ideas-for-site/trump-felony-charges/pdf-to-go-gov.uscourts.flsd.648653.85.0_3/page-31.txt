Case 9:23-cr-80101-AMC Document 85 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2023 Page 31 of 60

91. Just over two weeks after the FBI discovered classified documents in the Storage
Room and TRUMP’s office, on August 26, 2022, NAUTA called Trump Employee 5 and said
words to the effect of, “someone just wants to make sure Carlos is good.” In response, Trump
Employee 5 told NAUTA that DE OLIVEIRA was loyal and that DE OLIVEIRA would not do
anything to affect his relationship with TRUMP. That same day, at NAUTA’s request, Trump
Employee 5 confirmed in a Signal chat group with NAUTA and the PAC Representative that DE
OLIVEIRA was loyal. That same day, TRUMP called DE OLIVEIRA and told DE

OLIVEIRA that TRUMP would get DE OLIVEIRA an attorney.
