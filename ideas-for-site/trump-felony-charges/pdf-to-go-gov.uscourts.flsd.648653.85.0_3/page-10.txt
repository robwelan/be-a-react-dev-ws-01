TRUMP’s Retention of Classified Documents After His Presidency
25. — In January 2021, as he was preparing to leave the White House, TRUMP and his

White House staff, including NAUTA, packed items, including some of TRUMP’s boxes.
TRUMP was personally involved in this process. TRUMP caused his boxes, containing hundreds
of classified documents, to be transported from the White House to The Mar-a-Lago Club.

26. From January through March 15, 2021, some of TRUMP’s boxes were stored in
The Mar-a-Lago Club’s White and Gold Ballroom, in which events and gatherings took place.
TRUMP’s boxes were for a time stacked on the ballroom’s stage, as depicted in the photograph
