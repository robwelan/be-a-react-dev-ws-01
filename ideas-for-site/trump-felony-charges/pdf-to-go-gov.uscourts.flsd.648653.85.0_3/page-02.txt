that comprise the United States Intelligence Community and the United States Department of
Defense.

2. Over the course of his presidency, TRUMP gathered newspapers, press clippings,
letters, notes, cards, photographs, official documents, and other materials in cardboard boxes that
he kept in the White House. Among the materials TRUMP stored in his boxes were hundreds of
classified documents.

3. The classified documents TRUMP stored in his boxes included information
regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries; United
States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military
attack; and plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack. The unauthorized
disclosure of these classified documents could put at risk the national security of the United States,
foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued
viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods.

4. At 12:00 p.m. on January 20, 2021, TRUMP ceased to be president. As he departed
the White House, TRUMP caused scores of boxes, many of which contained classified documents,
to be transported to The Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he maintained his
residence. TRUMP was not authorized to possess or retain those classified documents.

5. The Mar-a-Lago Club was an active social club, which, between January 2021 and
August 2022, hosted events for tens of thousands of members and guests. After TRUMP’s
presidency, The Mar-a-Lago Club was not an authorized location for the storage, possession,
review, display, or discussion of classified documents. Nevertheless, TRUMP stored his boxes
containing classified documents in various locations at The Mar-a-Lago Club—including in a

ballroom, a bathroom and shower, an office space, his bedroom, and a storage room.
