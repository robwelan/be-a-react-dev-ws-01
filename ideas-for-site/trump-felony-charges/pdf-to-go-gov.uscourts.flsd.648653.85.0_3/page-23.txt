Good afternoon Walt,
Happy Memorial Day!

I saw you put boxes to Potus room. Just FYI and I
will tell him as well:

Not sure how many he wants to take on Friday on the
plane. We will NOT have a room for them. Plane will
be full with luggage.

Thank you!

NAUTA replied:

Good Afternoon Ma’am [Smiley Face Emoji]
Thank you so much.

I think he wanted to pick from them. I don’t imagine
him wanting to take the boxes.

He told me to put them in the room and that he was
going to talk to you about them.
