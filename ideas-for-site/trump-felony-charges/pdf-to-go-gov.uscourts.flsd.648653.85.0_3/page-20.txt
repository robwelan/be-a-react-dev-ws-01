Morning

*can we get new box covers before giving these to them on
Monday? They have too much writing on them..I marked too much

Trump Employee 2 replied, “Yes, I will get that!”

47. On January 17, 2022, Trump Employee 2 and NAUTA gathered 15 boxes from
TRUMP’ residence, loaded the boxes in NAUTA’s car, and took them to a commercial truck for
delivery to NARA.

48. | When interviewed by the FBI in May 2022 regarding the location and movement
of boxes before the production to NARA, NAUTA made false and misleading statements as set
forth in Count 38 of this Superseding Indictment, including:

a. falsely stating that he was not aware of TRUMP’s boxes being brought to
TRUMP’s residence for his review before TRUMP provided 15 boxes to
NARA in January 2022;

b. falsely stating that he did not know how the boxes that he and Trump
Employee 2 brought from TRUMP’s residence to the commercial truck for
delivery to NARA on January 17, 2022, had gotten to the residence; and

es when asked whether he knew where TRUMP’s boxes had been stored
before they were in TRUMP’s residence and whether they had been in a
secure or locked location, NAUTA falsely responded, “I wish, I wish I
could tell you. I don’t know. I don’t—I honestly just don’t know.”

49. | When the 15 boxes that TRUMP had provided reached NARA in January 2022,
NARA reviewed the contents and determined that 14 of the boxes contained documents with
classification markings. Specifically, as the FBI later determined, the boxes contained 197
documents with classification markings, of which 98 were marked “SECRET,” 30 were marked
“TOP SECRET,” and the remainder were marked “CONFIDENTIAL.” Some of those documents

also contained SCI and SAP markings.
