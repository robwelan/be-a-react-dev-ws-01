Case 9:23-cr-80101-AMC Document 85 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2023 Page 48 of 60

Question: So, you didn’t know—had no idea how they got there
before?
Answer: No.

112. The underscored statements and representations above were false, as NAUTA
knew, because (1) NAUTA did in fact know that the boxes in Pine Hall had come from the Storage
Room, as NAUTA himself, with the assistance of Trump Employee 2, had moved the boxes from
the Storage Room to Pine Hall; and (2) NAUTA had observed the boxes in and moved them to
various locations at The Mar-a-Lago Club.

All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001(a)(2).
