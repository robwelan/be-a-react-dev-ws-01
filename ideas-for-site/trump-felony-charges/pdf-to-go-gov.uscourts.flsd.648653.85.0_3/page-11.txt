Case 9:23-cr-80101-AMC Document 85 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/27/2023 Page 11 of 60

D7. In March 2021, NAUTA and others moved some of TRUMP’s boxes from the
White and Gold Ballroom to the business center at The Mar-a-Lago Club.

28. On April 5, 2021, an employee of The Office of Donald J. Trump (“Trump
Employee 1”) texted another employee of that office (“Trump Employee 2”) to ask whether
TRUMP’s boxes could be moved out of the business center to make room for staff to use it as an
office. Trump Employee 2 replied, “Woah!! Ok so potus specifically asked Walt for those boxes
to be in the business center because they are his ‘papers.’” Later that day, Trump Employee | and
Trump Employee 2 exchanged the following text messages:

Trump Employee 2:

We can definitely make it work if we move his
papers into the lake room?

Trump Employee 1:

There is still a little room in the shower where his
other stuff is. Is it only his papers he cares about?
Theres some other stuff in there that are not papers.
Could that go to storage? Or does he want everything
in there on property

Trump Employee 2:

Yes - anything that’s not the beautiful mind paper
boxes can definitely go to storage. Want to take a
look at the space and start moving tomorrow AM?

29. After the text exchange between Trump Employee | and Trump Employee 2, in
April 2021, some of TRUMP’s boxes were moved from the business center to a bathroom and

shower in The Mar-a-Lago Club’s Lake Room, as depicted in the photograph below.
