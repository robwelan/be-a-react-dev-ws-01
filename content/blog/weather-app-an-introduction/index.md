## Introduction

Hey there, budding developers! Are you ready to dive into the world of TypeScript and React and build something truly awesome? Well, you're in for a treat because, in this tutorial, we're going to create a fantastic weather app together! üå¶Ô∏è‚öõÔ∏è

Imagine having the power to fetch real-time weather updates for any location on the planet‚Äîall at your fingertips! That's exactly what we're going to achieve by learning how to use TypeScript and React to consume location and weather APIs. Don't worry if you're new to this; we'll take it step by step, making sure you not only understand the concepts but also have a blast doing it!

## What We‚Äôll Cover

1. Setting Up Your Development Environment
Let‚Äôs make sure you've got everything you need, from GatsbyJS and npm or yarn to a code editor like Visual Studio Code.

2. Introduction to TypeScript and React
A friendly overview of TypeScript and React for those who are just getting started. We'll keep it light and fun!

3. Choosing the Right APIs
We‚Äôll explore cool APIs that give us both location and weather data. Spoiler alert: it involves a bit of magic and some API keys!

4. Building the Foundation
Time to get hands-on! We‚Äôll set up GatsbyJS, create components, and make TypeScript our coding BFF.

5. Making API Requests with Axios
We‚Äôll learn how to talk to those awesome APIs using React-Query. It‚Äôs like teaching your app to ask nicely for weather info.

6. Rendering Weather Data
The moment of truth! Let's take the data we fetched and make it look stunning on our app. We're talking sunshine, raindrops, and a whole lot of React components!

7. Adding Flair with Chakra-UI
We need a way to display our data. Chakra-UI is a groovy way to do it.

8. Bonus Features
Feeling adventurous? You can add some extra features like a 5-day forecast or a dynamic background that changes based on the weather. The sky‚Äôs the limit!

By the end of this tutorial, you'll not only have a fully functional weather app but also a solid foundation in TypeScript and React. So, grab your favorite coding snack, put on your thinking cap, and let's weather this coding adventure together! ‚òÄÔ∏èüå®Ô∏è‚ö°

## What Now?

Ah, you will have to wait for the next exciting installment dear coder.

Thank you for reading thus far.

Happy coding and creating! üå¶Ô∏è‚öõÔ∏è
