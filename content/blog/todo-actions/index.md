## Introduction

Building a Todo application is a logical way to delve into the world of modern web development. In this guide, weâ€™ll introduce the concept of actions. Our powerful tech stack: GatsbyJS, TypeScript, ReactJS, Recoil, and Chakra-UI.

Now, letâ€™s dive in! ðŸ¤¿

## A Background In Doing Stuff

We are going to introduce the concept of actions here - in the context of user actions specifically. We need to think in terms of what types of actions a user of a Todo app might want to do. In broad terms a user is going to want to:

* Create (Add) a Todo item
* Read a Todo item
* Update (Edit) a Todo item
* Delete a Todo item
* Toggle an Item as Complete / Incomplete

## And What Actions Will We Need?

At a minimum, the required actions will be:

* Add
* Edit
* Delete
* Toggle completion

Because we will have access to a list of Todo items, we really do not need a specific Read action, as the list content will provide our individual items. Also, there is no need in our simple app to retrieve a specific item.

Filtering items by complete or incomplete is handled by Recoil in the state. You'll want to read <a href="https://beareact.dev/todo-let-us-look-at-the-recoil-state/" target="_blank">this article</a> if you want to understand the how to bits.

In the meantime, have a think about how the actions might work and what dependencies and payloads they will need in order to operate.

## What Now?

Ah, you will have to wait for the next exciting installment dear coder.

Thank you for reading thus far.

Happy coding and creating! ðŸŒŸðŸŽ‰
